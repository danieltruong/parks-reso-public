        <p class="card-text">Some of our most popular parks regularly experience high visitor volumes,
            resulting in
            crowding of facilities, packed parking lots, and safety issues. These environments do not easily allow for
            physical distancing and large numbers of visitors also have increased environmental impacts. The trail
            systems within these parks can become crowded at narrow pass points and view points which can lead to
            congestion and difficulties maintaining physical distancing.</p>
        <p>
            As of June 15, 2021, day use passes will be required to visit 7 of our busiest parks.
